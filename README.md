## Motivation
- The problem of garbage pollution is becoming dangerous day by day

- Plastic Garbage does not Decompose but it can be recycled

 - But there is no adequate system for its storage. 

- The aim here is to automatically sort the waste on conveyor lines


## Problem Statement
- The problem addressed in the base paper is the urgent technical problem of reducing environmental pollution with household waste and emissions from computing clusters

- The paper focuses on : improving the efficiency of waste recognition on recycling plant’s conveyor using deep learning only

- For this a unique open WaRP dataset is developed that shows the best diversity among industrial datasets and contains more than 10,000 images with 28 different types of recyclable goods

- Training and evaluation of cutting-edge deep neural networks for detection,classification and segmentation tasks on the WaRP dataset

- Additionally a hierarchical neural network approach called H-YC with weakly supervised segmentation is proposed which improves the detection quality and enable image segmentation using class labels,not masks

- The overall goal is to provide solutions that have great industrial application potential for waste recognition and reduction of environmental pollution 


## Dataset
- The dataset has three parts : WaRP-D, WaRP-C, and WaRP-S. 

- The first two parts are intended for training and objective quality assessment of detection (WaRP-D) and classification (WaRP-C) tasks

- The third WaRP-S is for validation of weakly supervised segmentation methods.
